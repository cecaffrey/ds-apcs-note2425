Effect of Doubling the Size on Running Time
​
 
name
Big-O notation
if the data is doubled, then the work is:
if n = 500 and takes 3 ms,
then n=1000 will take __ms
constant
 
O(1)
unchanged
 
 
log n
 
O(log n)
increased by 1 step
 
linear
 
O(n)
doubled
 
 
n log n
linearithmic
O(n log n)
2x < work < 4x
 
 
 
 
O(n3/2)
increased by a factor of 2
 
 
quadratic
 
O(n2)
increased by a factor of 22
 
 
 
O(n 3)
increased by a factor of 23
 
exponential
 
O(2n)
increased by a factor of 2n
