# ds-apcs-notes245
TJ Data Structures is technically the same credit as AP Computer Science A (I mean I took the AP test so...) but the class is like 10000x more complicated. I didn't even know that 80% of the content taught in DS wasn't even on the AP test. So idk if this will be helpful for someone not taking TJ APCSA+ but not my problem because what are you doing reading this if you're not and I'll probably never share this will anyone ever but idk.

Units:
01 Strings
02 Recursion
03 Sorting & Big-O
04 ListNode
05 Collections
06 Stacks & Queues (& Priority Queues)
07 


I know what I'm talking about:

But at the same time, I would never talk to anyone who didn't get a 5 on this exam because it's literally the easiest test I've ever taken for this course.
