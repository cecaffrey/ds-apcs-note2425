# ds-apcs-notes245
<ins>TJ Data Structures</ins> is technically the same credit as AP Computer Science A (I mean I took the AP test so...) but the class is like 10000x more complicated. I didn't even know that 80% of the content taught in DS wasn't even on the AP test. So idk if this will be helpful for someone not taking TJ APCSA+ but not my problem because what are you doing reading this if you're not and I'll probably never share this will anyone ever but idk. But pay attention in class because there are so many times I was about to fall asleep in class and I had to like shake myself awake because I would be so lost and I definitely would not have ended with an A if I didn't lock in yk.

# I know what I'm talking about: 

![a 5 on my AP CS exam(?), who even reads these alt text anyways](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/198b86f1-5212-4d7f-942e-687246bcabe3)

~~But at the same time, I would never talk to anyone who didn't get a 5 on this exam because it's literally the easiest test I've ever taken for this course.~~ <sub>Sorry</sub>
