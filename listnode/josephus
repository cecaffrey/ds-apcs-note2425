Josephus Problem
In a children's game, boys and girls sit in a circle and number off. Every Nth person must leave the circle. Whoever's left at the end is the winner.   For a given N and count, can you predict the position of the winner?  
 
Michael
Hannah
Jacob
Ruth
Matthew
 
 
 
 
 
Matthew
Michael
Hannah
Jacob
 
 
 
 
 
 
Matthew
Michael
Hannah
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Michael
Hannah
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Michael
 
 
 
 
For N = 5 and count = 4:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Starting position 1 is the winner.

For N = 5 and count = 2:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Starting position 3 is the winner.

For N = 5 and count = 1:
​
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Starting position 5 is the winner.
 
The trick is to figure out where to stand so as to be the last person left standing.  
 
 
Historical note
This problem gets its name from Flavius Josephus. In the 1st century AD, Josephus was a leader of a Jewish rebellion against Rome, was trapped in a cave, and somehow, amazingly, was the one who survived the circle of suicide.  He then switched sides, advised the Roman armies and emperor, and ended up writing several books about it all.

 The Circular Singly-linked List
The Josephus problem can be modeled by a circular linked list in which all nodes are linked in a continuous circle, without using null.  If we want to make a circular linked list storing B-C-D-E-F, most people will make "first" point to "B", as shown in the arrangement at the top.  In that case,
1. What is the Big-O to print the list? __________________

B

C

D

E

F

last
2. What is the Big-O to insert a "G" at the end, after the "F"? _________  
 
Now consider the arrangement of the nodes as shown at the bottom:  
3. What is the Big-O to print the list?___________  
4. What is the Big-O to insert a "G" at the end, after the "F"? ______    
 
➔ The list is B-C-D-E-F, but it is stored and processed as F-B-C-D-E for Big-O reasons.  
 
 
Josephus Lab Parts I and II
We will divide this program into two parts.  In the first part write the print and insert methods and test them.  The list is stored as F-B-C-D-E but it is printed as B-C-D-E-F.
 
Case 1:
 
 
 
 
Case 2:
The insert method should insert one (1) node, taking care to keep the list circular.  The insert method has two cases.  Draw them here:
 
In Part II, implement the Josephus game as a circular linked list. The driver plays the game twice, once with integers, which finds the winning position, and again with names.  After reading the names Michael, Hannah, Jacob, Ruth, and Matthew, your circular linked list should point to the last name, Matthew, like this:
 
 
 
 
 
This time, replace the name at the winning position with "Josephus", so that Josephus will always win.
 
Sample run:  For full credit format the output exactly as shown below.
B C D E F
How many names (2-20)? 5
How many names to count off each time? 2
1 2 3 4 5
3 4 5 1
5 1 3
3 5
3
3 wins!

****  Now start all over. ****

Where should Josephus stand?  3
Michael Hannah Josephus Ruth Matthew
Josephus Ruth Matthew Michael
Matthew Michael Josephus
Josephus Matthew
Josephus
Josephus wins!
